# What is MarkdownDB

MarkdownDB is a javascript library for treating markdown files as a database -- as a "MarkdownDB". Specifically, it:

-   Parses your markdown files to extract structured data (frontmatter, tags etc) and creates an index in a local SQLite database
-   Provides a lightweight javascript API for querying the database and importing files into your application
